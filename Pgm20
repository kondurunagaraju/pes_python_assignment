# 20.Write a program to generate Fibonacci series of numbers.
# Starting numbers are 0 and 1, new number in the series is generated by adding previous two numbers in the series.
# Example : 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,13,21,..... a) Number of elements printed in the series should be N numbers,
# Where N is any +ve integer. b) Generate the series until the element in the series is less than Max number.

num = int(input("Enter the no of terms : "))
a=0
b=1
if num <=0:
  print("please enter valid number  ")
elif num == 1:
  print("Fibonocci series is : ",a)
elif num == 2:
  print(a)
  print(b)
else:
  print(a)
  print(b)
  while(num > 2):
    numNext=a+b
    print (numNext)
    a=b
    b=numNext
    num = num-1
   
   
Output :
