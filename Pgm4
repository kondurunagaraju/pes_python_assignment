# Program to check if a number is prime or not

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# prime numbers are greater than 1
if num > 1:
    # check for factors
    for i in range(2, num):
        if (num % i) == 0:
            print(num, "is not a prime number")
           # print(i, "times", num // i, "is", num)
            break
    else:
        print(num, "is a prime number")

# if input number is less than
# or equal to 1, it is not prime
else:
    print(num, "is not a prime number")
    

Output: 

Enter a number: 13
13 is a prime number

Enter a number: 12
