#13.Write a program to find the biggest of 4 numbers.
# a) Read 4 numbers from user using Input statement.
# b) extend the above program to find the biggest of 5 numbers.
# ( PS : Use IF and IF & Else , If and ELIf, and Nested IF )

a, b, c, d = [int(x) for x in input("Enter 4 values: ").split()]
greatest=0

if (a>b)&(a>c)&(a>d):
    print("Greatest no of the first 4 is : ",a)
    greatest = a

elif (b>a)&(b>c)&(b>d):
    print("Greatest no of the first 4 is : ",b)
    greatest = b

elif (c>a)&(c>b)&(c>d):
    print("Greatest no of the first 4 is : ",c)
    greatest = c
else:
    print("Greatest no of the first 4 is : ",d)
    greatest = d

e = int(input("Enter 5th number : "))

if(e > greatest):
    print("The greatest of all 5 nos is : ",e)
else:
    print("Fifth number is smaller than the greatest number of first 4 numbers.")
    
    
Output :
---------

Enter 4 values: 11 22 44 33
Greatest no of the first 4 is :  44
Enter 5th number : 12
Fifth number is smaller than the greatest number of first 4 numbers.


Enter 4 values: 11 22 44 33
Greatest no of the first 4 is :  44
Enter 5th number : 55
The greatest of all 5 nos is :  55
