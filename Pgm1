# Python program to perform Addition Subtraction Multiplication
# and Division of two numbers

result = 0
if ch == '+':
    result = num1 + num2
elif ch == '-':
    result = num1 - num2
elif ch == '*':

Output:

Enter First Number: 12
Enter Second Number: 12
Enter which operation would you like to perform (+,-,*,/)?/
12 / 12  is : 1.0


Enter First Number: 12
Enter Second Number: 12
Enter which operation would you like to perform (+,-,*,/)?+
12 + 12  is : 24

Enter First Number: 12
Enter Second Number: 12
Enter which operation would you like to perform (+,-,*,/)?*
12 * 12  is : 144

Enter First Number: 12
Enter Second Number: 12
Enter which operation would you like to perform (+,-,*,/)?-
12 - 12  is : 0

Enter First Number: 12
Enter Second Number: 12
Enter which operation would you like to perform (+,-,*,/)?@
