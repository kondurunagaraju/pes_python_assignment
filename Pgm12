Output:
--------

Enter 10 values: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
Average of the entered 10 nos is :  5.5
Number(s) smaller than the Average is : 
a =  1
b =  2
c =  3
d =  4
e =  5
Total count of nums bigger than average is :  5
Total count of nums smaller than average is :  5
Total count of nums equal to the average is :  0
